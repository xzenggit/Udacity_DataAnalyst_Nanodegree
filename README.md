# Projects for [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

Learn to clean up messy data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using machine learning, and clearly communicate critical findings.

## P0: Find the optimal chopstick length

Set up iPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal length of chopsticks and present findings.

## P1: Test a perceptual phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give ya good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

## P2: Investigate a dataset

Investigate a dataset using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing findings.

## P3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap data

Choose an area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data.

## P4: Explore and summarize data

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## P5: Identify fraud from Enron email

Play detective and put machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

## P6: Make effective data visulization

Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js to create the visualization.

## P7: Design an A/B test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
