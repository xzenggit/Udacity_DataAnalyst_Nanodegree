## Test a perceptual phenomenon

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give ya good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### Overview

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). we will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret your results in terms of hypotheses.

### What will I learn?

This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:
* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
