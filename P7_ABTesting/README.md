## Design an A/B test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

### Why this Project?

This project requires to both make design decisions about how to run an A/B Test and analyze the results. Both are important skills for drawing conclusions based on online experiments.

### What I learned

* Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
* Characterize and validate those metrics
* Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
* Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
* Draw a conclusion based on the results
* Recommend whether or not to launch the change
