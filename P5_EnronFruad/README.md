## Identify fraud from Enron email

Play detective and put machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### Why this Project?

This project teaches the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

It shows how to extract and identify useful features that best represent data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.
